_"An organised disorder requires discipline, and a simulated fear requires bravery; however, I don't know how to do either" ~Sun Tsu, the Art of War_

## Dumb Italian factuse's

- I am interested in game development and I am genuinly intrigued with game modding
- Learns too much stuff altogether, just to then add it to the "oh wow that's really not..." list
- Will probably join random projects for utter enjoyment of pain
- Proud owner of a Raspberry Pi which I enslave regularly
- I use arch btw
- Fun fact: I helped in the making of [![deviceorchestra](https://img.shields.io/youtube/views/lHZkLLRvZFw?label=DeviceOrchestra&style=social)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZkLLRvZFw) sound tab trasmigrator

## Projects I'm involved in
- [Crafty Items](https://github.com/SweetieRick/Craftyitems)
It's my biggest Minecraft mod yet. It adds tons of new ways to craft items that beautifully integrate 
- [GuildFight](https://github.com/GuildFight)
Imagine a game... in which Guilds all over Discord partake in a great battlefield!
This is a passion project which simbolizes all things I've learned about chatbot development, from the most basic of bots until complicated and complex bots which are able to be managed by a dashboard, interact with a custom crafted API and much more exciting stuff. Keep an eye for it's public release!
- [Swamp Overseer](https://github.com/SweetieRick/SwampOverseer)
A little Discord project that started for a server with some friends and now evolved into a full blown community around memes, good talks and Shrek prayers. The Swamp Overseer is my hand-in help to the user-base that brings custom built minigames, image manipulation commands and some funny experiments.
- [Lost 3d Brother](https://github.com/SweetieRick/3dbrother)
A prominent beta-focused sm64 ROM hack, which brings and plans to bring a lot of content from the Super Mario 64 beta builds which was lost in time. While doing do, it evolves into a full blown storyline that you will need to discover yourself...
