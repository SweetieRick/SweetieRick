## Dumb Italian factuse's

- I am interested in game development and I am genuinly intrigued with game modding
- Learns too much stuff altogether, just to then add it to the "oh wow that's really not..." list
- Will probably join random projects for utter enjoyment of pain
- Proud owner of a Raspberry Pi which I enslave regularly
- I use arch btw
- Fun fact: I helped in the making of [![deviceorchestra](https://img.shields.io/youtube/views/lHZkLLRvZFw?label=DeviceOrchestra&style=social)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHZkLLRvZFw) sound tab trasmigrator
