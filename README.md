## Projects I'm involved in
- [GuildFight](https://github.com/GuildFight)
Imagine a game... in which Guilds all over Discord partake in a great battlefield!
This is a passion project which simbolizes all things I've learned about chatbot development, from the most basic of bots until complicated and complex bots which are able to be managed by a dashboard, interact with a custom crafted API and much more exciting stuff. Keep an eye for it's public release!
- [Swamp Overseer](https://github.com/SweetieRick/SwampOverseer)
A little Discord project that started for a server with some friends and now evolved into a full blown community around memes, good talks and Shrek prayers. The Swamp Overseer is my hand-in help to the user-base that brings custom built minigames, image manipulation commands and a lot more to organise this growing and ever changing community. It's also complemented by this [website](https://github.com/SweetieRick/swamp-church-web) which will serve as a landing page for this bot's dashboard
- [Lost 3d Brother](https://github.com/SweetieRick/3dbrother)
A prominent beta-focused sm64 ROM hack, which brings and plans to bring a lot of content from the Super Mario 64 beta builds which was lost in time. While doing do, it evolves into a full blown storyline that you will need to discover yourself...
- [Crafty Items](https://github.com/SweetieRick/Craftyitems)
One of my first Minecraft mods to ever surface into my GitHub and basically anywhere. It plans to add a lot of content and crafting recipes to the main game in order to complement the simple and known crafting system with a ton of new ways to craft useful things needed for your survival. It plans to be as vanilla-friendly as possible while also being pretty substantial
